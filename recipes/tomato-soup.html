        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Combine tomatoes, chicken broth, garlic coves, 
                and a large slice of onion in a stockpot over medium heat. 
                Bring to a boil, and gently simmer for about 20 minutes to blend flavors.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl, 
                or pan. Discard any stuff left over in the food mill.</li>
                <li>Melt butter over medium heat in the now empty stockpot. Stir in flour to make 
                a roux by cooking, whisking constantly, until mixture turns medium brown.</li>
                <li>Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture to prevent lumps from forming, 
                then stir in the rest.</li>
                <li>Season with sugar and salt to taste.</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
