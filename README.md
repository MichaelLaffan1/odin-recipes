Beginner HTML Recipe Website for the Odin Project

This project serves as a beginner HTML project for the Odin Project. This
project will involve listing recipes for foods found online. It will include the ingredients required and the steps to make the dish. 

By the end of this project, I will have learned how to utilize HTML lists to list out ingredients and steps necessary for each dish. I will also have the knowledge on how to display images on HTML pages through the use of the image tag. Finally, I will have learned how to link other pages to the index page of the recipe website.
